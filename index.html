          <p>
            Family meals provide an opportunity for family members to come
            together, strengthen ties and build better relationships. In our
            overscheduled lives being together with family at dinner is really
            important, as old tradition used to be.

          <h3 class="title1">Shelter for a family</h3>
          <p>
            Perhaps love is like a resting place, a shelter from the storm. It
            exists to give you comfort, it is there to keep you warm, and in
            those times of trouble when you are most alone, the memory of love
            will bring you home.

          <h3 class="title1">Education for a child</h3>
          <p>
            Education is one of the most powerful aspects of life. Education and
            learning allow us to make sense of the world around us, the world
            inside of us, and where we fit within the world.The world within us
            is everything internal; like our mind, our body, and our emotions.

        <p>
          One of the marvelous things about community is that it enables us to
          welcome and help people in a way we couldn’t as individuals. When we
          pool our strength and share the work and responsibility, we can
          welcome many people, even those in deep distress, and perhaps help
          them find self-confidence and inner healing.
